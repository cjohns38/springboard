# Cleaning

* The O*NET database is a relatively clean commerical databases requiring relatively little cleaning.  Since the analyses for this project is text, text level cleaning was done. Specifically, we using the python module NLTK version 3.2.3.  Textual components were tokenized using the nltk work_tokenize and english stop words were removed using the nltk corpus english stopwords list.  All text was converted to lower case and common punctuation was removed ('.', '?', '!', ','). 
* Exploritory word stemming was done using nltk's PorterStemmer.  
* Scale level data (e.g. Tasks, Work Activities, Skills, etc) were included if 
raters gave rated it as a 3 (Important) or higher.  
* Textual values were obtained by joining rating data with the textual descriptions.  For example, the work_activities table was joined with the content_model_reference on the element_id.
